AVS
===

Physicians and patients tend to overestimate patient understanding of medical instructions.  In addition, the more information patients are given, the less they remember.   Lack of patient understanding of instructions leads to poor adherence, medication errors, missed appointments, and perceptions of poor physician communication with patients. Patient discharge instructions that summarize medications, appointments, upcoming tests and other instructions enhances patient retention and understanding of physician instructions.


After visit summaries (AVS) have been promoted as a means to enhance communication, engage patients, and improve patient’s recall of the instructions conveyed during an outpatient visit.  Currently, many commercial electronic health records provide automated discharge instruction sheets. 


The VA After-Visit Summary (AVS) is designed to automatically capture data from CPRS including visit information, orders, instructions and more, and reformat the information into a patient-centered, clinic discharge summary for veteran outpatients.  The goal of the AVS is to increase patient’s comprehension of health information, engagement In their care and satisfaction with outpatient appointments in way that is user-friendly to clinical staff.
